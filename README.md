# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-Means Clustering) to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic data. The goal is to help businesses target specific customer groups with personalized marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

- Segment customers into distinct groups based on features like age, income, and spending score.
- Visualize clusters to understand customer behavior and trends.
- Enable data-driven marketing and sales strategies.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any Python IDE

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset typically contains:
- Customer ID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1-100)

## 📊 Process Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for nulls, removed duplicates, and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions and relationships using boxplots and scatter plots.
3. **Feature Scaling (if required)**
4. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Used Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters (WCSS plot).
   - Applied K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
5. **Visualization:**
   - Plotted customer segments with color-coded scatter plots.
   - Explained each cluster's characteristics.
